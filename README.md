# How do I approach designing software? 
I approach designing software from a object oriented approach with a focus on test-driven and iterative methods. Work on this project improved my understanding of openGL commands and object orientation in 3-D space. I also utilized the concept of the minimum viable product in order to ensure that I could meet goals by the end of the development cycle. I will continue to use this strategy in future endeavors

# How do I approach developing programs?
When developing a program, this often involves utilization of multiple classes and components, so I make sure to emphasize portability and reusability of code when creating components so that they can be used in other parts of the program with minimal alterations. I am careful to use easy to understand naming conventions and create my code with consistent code structure so that review is a simple process. Iterative development was used to create components of the project, such as each method and class so that consistent progress could be made and the appropriate tests could be made at every step of development.

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computation graphics and visualizations was a great opportunity to learn the fundamentals behind graphic generation in openGL. This is relevant to my future goal of using the knowledge I gain to better understand the programming behind video games so that I can mod them.
